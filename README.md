These are my instructions These are my own steps instructions on how to setup the Nexus 6P phone to work with Kali NetHunter. These steps are for the Angler version (6P) of Nexus and also include downgrading from Oreo (8.1.0) to Nougat (7.1.1). The files required in the phone are included in the zip_file folder but some need to be in the phone itself. Once you have connectivity navigate to the sites to get them...the file that need to be in your phone and installed in order using TWRP are:

1. SR3-SuperSU-v2.82-SR3-20170813133244.zip
2. nethunter-generic-arm64-kalifs-full-rolling-[VERSION].zip (Kali FS)
3. kernel-nethunter-angler-nougat-[VERSION].zip (Kernel)

If you decide not to downgrade, then you need to find the correct files for that version. Use the links in the steps to get more files and instructions.

PS: If you have problems with ADB then reboot directly to Bootloader using Power + Volume down buttons.
